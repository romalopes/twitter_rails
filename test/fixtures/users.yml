# model remove the "{}" from the fixture names and add the columns immediately
# below each fixture, per the syntax in the comments below

one: {}
# column: value
#
two: {}
# column: value

# <% password_digest = BCrypt::Password.create("password") %>

# one:
#   email_address: one@example.com
#   password_digest: <%= password_digest %>

# two:
#   email_address: two@example.com
#   password_digest: <%= password_digest %>
